    <strong>Climate</strong>
    <br></br>
    Fortaleza has a typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate">tropical climate</a>, specifically a tropical wet and dry climate, with high temperatures and relative humidity throughout the year. However, these conditions are usually relieved by pleasant winds blowing from the ocean. Average temperatures are not much different throughout the year. December is the warmest month, with a high of 31.7 °C (89.1 °F)[11] and low of 24.9 °C (76.8 °F).[12] The rainy season spans from January to July, with rainfall particularly prodigious in March and April.[13] The average annual temperature is 27.0 °C (80.6 °F).[14] The relative humidity in Fortaleza is 77.5%,[15] with average annual rainfall of 1,584.0 millimetres (62.36 in).[13] There is usually rain during the first seven months of the year from January to July. During this period, relative humidity is high. Fortaleza's climate is usually very dry from August to December, with very little rainfall.[13][15]

    Rainfall is like all of Northeastern Brazil among the most variable in the world, comparable (for similar average annual rainfalls) to central Queensland cities like Townsville and Mackay.[16] In the notorious drought year of 1877 as little as 468 millimetres or 18.43 inches fell, and in 1958 only 518 millimetres or 20.39 inches, but in the Nordeste's record wet year of 1985 Fortaleza received 2,841 millimetres or 111.85 inches.

    <p id="2"><strong>Colonial period</strong>
    <br></br>
        <strong>Colonisation</strong> began in 1603 when Portugal was part of the Iberian Union, when the Portuguese Pero Coelho de Souza constructed the Fort of São Tiago and founded the settlement of Nova Lisboa (New Lisbon).[citation needed] After a victory over the French in 1612, Martins Soares Moreno expanded the Fort of São Tiago and changed its name to Forte de São Sebastião.[5]
<br></br>
            In 1630 the Dutch invaded the Brazilian Northeast and in 1637 they took the Fort of São Sebastião and ruled over Ceará. In battles with the Portuguese and natives in 1644 the fort was destroyed.[5] Under captain Matthias Beck the Dutch West Indies Company built a new fortress by the banks of river Pajeú. Fort Schoonenborch ("graceful stronghold") officially opened on August 19, 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assunção ("Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption"), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.[6]

            Fortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Ceará state in 1799.[7]</p>

        <p id="3"><strong>Ecology and environment</strong>
            <br></br>
            In Fortaleza there are some remaining areas of mangrove in preserved areas, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coc%C3%B3_Park"> Cocó Park.</a> Ten miles offshore is the Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park, created in 1997 to protect the reefs.[22]
            <br></br>
            The vegetation of Fortaleza is typically coastal. The restinga areas are found in dune regions near the mouths of the Ceará, Cocó and Pacoti rivers, in the beds of which there is still a mangrove forest. In other green areas of the city, there is no longer native vegetation, consisting of varied vegetation, fruit trees more commonly.[23] The city is home to seven environmental conservation units. These are the Sabiaguaba Dunes Municipal Natural Park, the Sabiaguaba Environmental Protection Area, the Maraponga Lagoon Ecological Park, the Cocó Ecological Park, the Ceará River Estuary Environmental Protection Area, the Environmental Protection Area of the Rio Pacoti and the Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park.[24] There is also, in the city, the Area of Relevant Ecological Interest of Sírio Curió, that protects the last enclave of Atlantic Forest in the urban zone.[25]
